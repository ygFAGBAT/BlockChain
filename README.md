• Using Python to simulate block chain mining

• Adding Transactions to each block

• Reward a miner when mined a block and add to the chain

• Using Flask to create an API to have multiple miners to mine the blocks

• Implementing the Consensus Algorithm to find the longest chain and replace the other chains
